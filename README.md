***The functionality we will be providing and how other groups can use it***

The interface provided will allow users to interact with the sensors without having to use GrovePi API, allowing the user to work strictly with Java code.

For example, methods would allow users to specify what data they want from the light sensor, such as light intensity, or specify certain messages for the LCD RGB Backlight to display to their users.

We will initially provide code that incorporates light sensors and temperature and humidity sensors. The devices we will include are LEDs and the LCD RGB Backlight. The interfaces are expandable to easily add other sensors and devices.
